        <p>Security control refers to the set of protocols, policies, practices, etc. that is taken in order to fulfill
            cybersecurity. They are such controls taken to protect digital devices from any vulnerabilities and threats.
            They are
            necessary for the following reasons:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>They help to protect digital assets from external threats.</li>
            <li>They help protect sensitive data from potential leak or breach.</li>
            <li>They also fulfill regulatory compliance.</li>
            <li>They ensure CIA of information.</li>
            <li>They minimize risks and maintain workflow in an organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Cybersecurity Controls</h2>

        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Physical controls:</b> It involves security controls developed to protect physical infrastructure and
                assets
                from damage,
                theft or unauthorized access. Example, CCTV surveillance, Biometrics entry system, Locks in gates and
                windows, Security
                Guards.</li>
            <li><b>Procedural controls:</b> It involves policy, practice and processes to be followed by human to ensure
                cybersecurity.
                Example, security awareness, data handling plans, Incident Response plans.</li>
            <li><b>Legal controls:</b> It involves the laws, rules and regulations, compliance that an organization
                should
                follow for
                cybersecurity. Example, HIPPA compliance, contracts and agreements, GDPR.</li>
            <li><b>Technical controls:</b> It involves security measures implemented through technology. Example,
                firewalls,
                Access Control
                Systems, IDS, IPS, Anti malwares, Encryption.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Defense Approach</h2>
        <p>The four step approaches for cybersecurity defense are:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Identify:</b> It is the first step which involves identifying the assets in an organization which are
                vulnerable to threats.
                The assets include data and information, system, network, application, etc. It also involves listing
                other resources
                that can be indirectly harmed.</li>
            <li><b>Assess:</b> It is the next step which involves analyzing. The identified risks and threats are
                analyzed to
                understand how it
                can affect the system and to what extent. Also, the risks need to be prioritized to figure out what
                should be deal with
                first.</li>
            <li><b>Protect:</b> It includes the protective measures. Implementing policies, firewalls, IDS and IPS,
                biometrics
                and multi-factor
                authentication, etc. fall in this step. The identified risks should be mitigated by adopting effective
                security
                measures.</li>
            <li><b>Monitor:</b> This step involves continuous monitoring of system and network to detect any suspicious
                or
                malicious action. It
                involves monitoring logs and also user activities to detect any social engineering.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Business Continuity Planning (BCP)</h2>
        <p>BCP (Business Continuity Plan) is a set of plans and policies that mention how an
            organization will function in case of incidents such as disasters, cyberattacks, etc. which
            can disrupt the organization assets. BCP addresses the following things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying risks (threats and vulnerabilities) and creating identify-assessment
                prioritize plan.
            </li>
            <li>Analyze the possible losses of assets and how they can impact the organization.</li>
            <li>Develop response, recovery and post-incident plans.</li>
            <li>Develop communication plans.</li>
            <li>Develop backups for important data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)</h2>
        <p>DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan) is a set of plans that outlines how an organization respond to and recover from
            any
            unfortunate events or disasters. This plan ensures minimal downtime, protects critical assets, and maintains
            business
            continuity.</p>
