        <h1>Backing up your data</h1>

        <img src="../../pictures/backup.jpg">

        <p>Data is a valuable asset in today’s digital world. Data is basically any information. We may possess personal
            data,
            business data, school data and so many more which are very important to us. These data also have different
            risks. We may
            lose our data due to any unfortunate events. Thus, data backup is a vital solution to this problem.</p>
        <p>Data backup refers to creating copies of data. It means to store data in more than one place. It is very
            important to
            backup data because there are many threats that can destroy or modify the data we have.</p>

        <h2>Threats to data in our computer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cyber attack</li>
            <li>Hardware failure/ damage to computer system</li>
            <li>Natural disasters that can damage the computer</li>
            <li>Accidental deletion or modification of data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reasons to backup data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To prevent data from being lost by unfortunate events.</li>
            <li>To allow business to continue with the backed-up data if such unfortunate events occur.</li>
            <li>To reduce recovery cost for such events.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of data backup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Local backups:</b> Local backups involve creating copies of the data in another device such as USB,
                flash, external hard
                drives, Network-Attached Storage (NAS), etc. This method doesn’t use internet connection and uses
                devices. The data
                backed up in using local backup can be accessed easily. However, the storage capacity and vulnerable to
                theft can be the
                issues.</li>
            <li><b>Cloud storage:</b> Cloud storage involves storing data on servers hosted on internet managed by
                third-party service
                providers. Some of the popular cloud storage media are Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon Web
                Service (AWS), etc.
                Cloud use internet, and thus the data can be accessible from multiple devices. It protects against
                physical damage. The
                storage limitation is also not the problem. But, being dependent on internet can bring many issues. The
                data can be
                accessible only via internet connection, and it also may possess security risks.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Types of backups</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Full backups:</b> It is the backup technique where entire data is backed up.</li>
            <li><b>Incremental backups:</b> When any data, which was also backed up before, is modified or changed, then
                incremental backup
                only backup that changed data.</li>
            <li><b>Differential backups:</b> It backups all the changed data since last full backup.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best practices for data backups</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>3-2-1 rule:</b> The 3-2-1 rule of backup means you need to have three copies your data. Two of them
                should
                be backed up on
                different local storages and one in cloud.</li>
            <li><b>Backup scheduling:</b> While automatic backups for files is also possible, it is recommended to
                backup data
                according to a
                schedule that you can create (weekly or monthly).</li>
            <li><b>Backup testing:</b> You should check for backed up files and ensure they work properly and can be
                restored.
            </li>
        </ul>
