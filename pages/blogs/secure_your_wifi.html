        <p>Nowadays, almost every home and office relies on Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. But not many of us are
            keen to secure
            our Wi-Fi. Unsecured Wi-Fi can make you vulnerable to hackers. Let’s look at some effective tips for
            securing your Wi-Fi
            and keeping your network safe.
        </p>

        <h2>Why securing WiFi matters?</h2>
        <p>Your Wi-Fi network is the gateway to the internet and all the devices connected to it. If someone gains
            unauthorized
            access, they can monitor your internet activity, steal personal data, or even commit illegal activities
            using your
            network. So, securing your Wi-Fi is crucial for protecting yourself from these disasters.
        </p>

        <h2>Steps to secure your WiFi</h2>
        <p><b>Change the Default Router Login Credentials</b>: Most Wi-Fi routers come with default usernames and
            passwords like "admin" or
            "password." These default settings are widely known and make it easy for hackers to access your network.
            Changing these
            login credentials should be your first step.
        </p>
        <p><b>Use Strong Encryption (WPA3 or WPA2)</b>: Wi-Fi encryption secures the data traveling between your
            devices and the router. It is essential to use the latest
            encryption standard available. Currently, WPA3 is the most secure, but if your router doesn’t support
            it, WPA2 is still
            a strong option. You should avoid using older encryption standards like WEP, which can be easily hacked.
        </p>
        <p><b>Create a Strong Wi-Fi Password</b>: Your Wi-Fi password should be a mix of letters, numbers, and
            symbols and should avoid common words or phrases. Check out the password strength checker to test the
            strength of your password.
        </p>
        <p><b>Turn Off WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)</b>: WPS is a feature designed to make it easier to connect
            devices to your Wi-Fi by using a simple PIN. However, this
            feature is highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks. It is better to disable WPS in your router settings
            to prevent easy
            access.
        </p>
        <p><b>Update Your Router Firmware</b>: Just like your phone or computer, your router's firmware requires
            updates to patch security vulnerabipties. Regularly
            updating your router helps protect it from the latest security threats.
        </p>
        <p><b>Enable Guest Network</b>: If you have visitors or devices that don’t need access to your main
            network, enable a guest Wi-Fi network. This keeps
            your personal devices separate from other connected devices, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p><b>Monitor Your Network</b>: Many routers allow you to view a list of connected devices. Keep track of
            this list to ensure only trusted devices are
            connected. If you see something that you don’t recognize, it could be a sign of an unauthorized user,
            and you should
            remove its connectivity from your Wi-Fi.
        </p>

        <p>Securing your Wi-Fi is an important step in protecting your home network and personal data. By creating
            strong passwords
            and updating your router firmware, you can secure your connection and stay safe online. Even little
            steps will help in
            some way to keep yourself protected.</p>
