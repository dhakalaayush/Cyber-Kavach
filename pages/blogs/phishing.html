        <h1>Phishing</h1>

        <img src="../../pictures/phishing.jpg">

        <p>Phishing is a social engineering attack. Social engineering attack involves manipulating a person socially to
            get
            necessary information. Example, convincing someone to reveal their sensitive credentials. In phishing, the
            attacker
            mimics being someone else, such as bank, agencies or any other institutions. For example, the attacker can
            create a fake
            bank account and send target an email stating that his/her bank account will be suspended if he doesn’t
            reply the email
            mentioning his credentials. So, the key takeaway is that phishing is an online scam where attackers try to
            trick us into
            revealing sensitive information.</p>

        <h2>Key features of phishing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The attacker impersonates to be a legitimate person or organization.</li>
            <li>The main goal of attacker is to get sensitive information from the target.</li>
            <li>The website or email of phishing seems to be legitimate but contains malicious code, or aims to steal
                personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Analyzing phishing attack</h2>
        <img src="../../pictures/phishing_email.png">
        <p>This is an email received from Washington bank which says that the customer account is about to be suspended
            and the
            credentials need to be replied to this email. This obviously looks suspicious but there are some important
            things to
            consider, which are the characteristics of phishing emails.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Name: </b> If looked at the name of the sender carefully, it misspells Washington. This is because
                the
                attacker cannot use
                the legitimate domain of the actual Washington bank.</li>
            <li><b>Grammatical error:</b> The email reads ‘We wants you to reply’, which is grammatically incorrect.
                These
                mistakes are made
                to escape the email filter systems. Email filtering is what sends an email to spam folder.</li>
            <li><b>Fear:</b> Any email from a legitimate organization doesn’t use fearsome language like the email
                above. One
                of the major
                characteristics of phishing email is the fearsome language.</li>
            <li><b>Communication:</b> A bank would never ask for a credential over an email. Any organization would have
                a
                verified way of
                communicating such sensitive information.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Types of phishing</h2>
        <p>A phishing email may be targeted to many people, a specific person and via various ways. There are different
            types of
            phishing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Spear phishing:</b> Spear phishing is targeted to a specific person. For example, a phishing email
                targeting
                a
                receptionist at a hotel convincing to give some valuable information about a person staying at that
                hotel.</li>
            <li><b>Whaling:</b> Whaling is a spear phishing targeted to a high-profile individuals like CEOs and
                executives.
            </li>
            <li><b>Smishing (SMS phishing):</b> Smishing is phishing via SMS. It involves sending malicious links or
                asking for
                sensitive
                information via SMS text.</li>
            <li><b>Vishing (Voice phishing):</b> Vishing is phishing via voice calls. The attacker pretends to be a
                legitimate
                person and ask
                for valuable information via phone call. Example of vishing is tech support calls, where the attacker
                impersonates to be
                from a tech support and ask for credentials to fix some issues.</li>
            <li><b>Clone phishing:</b> Like the name suggests, the attacker clones a legitimate email, but modifying it
                slightly. For
                example, the attacker can copy a legitimate email from an organization that the target had received,
                attach malicious
                links or login forms to steal information, and resend it to the target.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Protecting from phishing</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Always check the email or messages for grammatical errors or fearsome language.</li>
            <li>Always verify the source of emails and messages.</li>
            <li>Do not spill out confidential information over email or phone calls.</li>
            <li>Always contact with the actual organization when received any email which seems to be from that
                organization.</li>
            <li>Avoid clicking links without verification.</li>
            <li>Enable Multifactor Authentication to protect your account even if you submit the username and password
                to
                the
                attacker.</li>
        </ul>
