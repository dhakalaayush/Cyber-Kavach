        <h1>Defense-in-depth and Technical Cybersecurity</h1>

        <img src="../../pictures/defense_in_depth.jpg">

        <p>Defense in depth is a cybersecurity concept which means multiple layers of cybersecurity. It involves
            applying security
            protocols at multiple layers around an IT infrastructure. The objective of defense in depth is to ensure
            that if one of
            the protocol or measure fails, there are still other ones to compliment. A real-life analogy would be a
            castle. There
            would be a king sleeping in a room within the castle. To protect him, there is a secure room with guards on
            the door.
            The room would be within a building with strong brick-walls. The main door of the building will have locks
            and also
            guarded by guards. The building will be surrounded by fence and there will be guards in the entrance there
            too. There
            will also be watch gates and other security measures. Defense in depth has similar concept. It has different
            tools and
            techniques covering network, application, endpoint and even social aspects.</p>

        <p><b>Attack Surface:</b> The target in a cyber-attack is called attack surface. It is the things that are
            vulnerable to
            cyber-attack. For example, company website, employee portal, email accounts, passwords, etc. These are the
            possible
            vectors from which an adversary can extract information. The attack surface covers defense points like data,
            devices,
            applications, networks and systems. Attack surface is critical in cybersecurity because it identifies the
            possible
            points of cyber-attack in an organization.</p>

        <h2>Lifecycle of cyber attack</h2>
        <p>The process of malware infection follows four phases.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Infection:</b> The attacker injects malware into the computer system. This could be done via email
                attachments, Infected
                USB, hacking (accessing the computer system) and so on.</li>
            <li><b>Persistence:</b> The infected malware will look to stay persistent. It will disable defenses. It
                replicates itself so
                that even if it is removed, it can re-install itself. It forms copies and spread throughout the system.
                When malware is
                installed in MBR (Master Boot Records), it re installs every time the operating system is booted, thus
                making it
                difficult to remove. It also achieves persistence by creating backdoor, which can help the adversary
                coordinate the
                malware.</li>
            <li><b>Communication:</b> Communication is critical for malwares. A malware itself cannot perform all the
                tasks itself. It needs
                active instructions from the author. Communication is also necessary for the author to receive
                information from the
                infected computer.</li>
            <li><b>Control:</b> Once the malware is in place and communicating, then the attacker can take control,
                updating it, controlling
                and coordinating the attack.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Methods of technical defense</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Anti-malware:</b> It is the software that can protect a computer system against malwares. Malwares
                have
                signature which
                are its unique features like its file size, file type, extension, data usage pattern, methods of
                operation, etc. An
                anti-malware software can detect this pattern and recognize malware. Then, it moves the malicious file
                to a location
                where it cannot execute and is basically not functional at all. It then notifies the user and takes
                action.</li>
            <li><b>IDS (Intrusion Detection System):</b> IDS detects any malicious activity in a system or network, and
                alerts. It doesnâ€™t
                affect network performance.</li>
            <li><b>IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):</b> It detects and also perform actions to prevent such malicious
                activity. It affects
                network performance as there will be delay in IPS processing.</li>
            <li><b>Firewall:</b> Firewalls are located at the edge of a network. Its job is to filter incoming and
                outgoing
                network traffic.
                At early times, firewalls used to filter data packets. So, it could not protect against data spoofing.
                Firewalls can
                also include IDS and IPS. A firewall may be software or a hardware.</li>
            <li><b>Encryption and Cryptography:</b> Cryptography is the process of translating information into secure
                format. It is the art
                of creating codes using encryption and decryption. Encryption is a part of cryptography. It is the
                process where
                information is hidden using certain algorithms.</li>
            <li><b>Proxy servers:</b> Proxy servers are the middle-man between the computer and the internet. When a
                computer makes a
                request, the proxy sends the request to the internet, and when internet sends back response, the proxy
                sends it to the
                device. A proxy has security features as well. It hides the original IP address of the device masking
                with the proxy IP
                address. It also prevents direct access to the internet thus making it difficult for the attacker to
                gain access to the
                device.</li>
