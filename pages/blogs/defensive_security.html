        <h1>Defensive Security</h1>

        <img src="../../pictures/CyberSecurity.jpg">

        <p>Defensive security refers to measures and strategies used to protect networks, systems, and data from
            cyberattacks. By
            being proactive and implementing defensive security practices, you can mitigate the risk of cyber threats
            and safeguard
            your digital life. Here are some of the most common cyber threats and defensive measures.
        </p>

        <h2>Phishing</h2>
        <p>Phishing is one of the most widespread cyber threats, where attackers pose as legitimate entities to trick
            victims into
            revealing personal information, such as login credentials or financial data. Phishing emails or fake
            websites often
            mimic trusted brands and manipulate victims into clicking malicious links.</p>
        <h3>How to protect against Phishing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify the sender's email address.</li>
            <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments.</li>
            <li>Use email filtering tools to detect and block phishing attempts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Malware</h2>
        <p>Malware is malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorised access to computer systems or networks.
            It
            includes viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Malware can be spread through infected downloads,
            compromised
            websites, or malicious email attachments.
        </p>
        <h3>How to protect against malware</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Install and update antivirus software regularly.</li>
            <li>Avoid downloading files from unknown sources.</li>
            <li>Keep your operating system and applications up to date with security patches.</li>
            <li>Frequently backup files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Man-in-the-Middle attack</h2>
        <p>In these types of attacks, cybercriminals intercept communication between two bodies or devices to steal
            sensitive
            information, such as login credentials, personal data, or internet activity. This type of attack often
            occurs on
            insecure public Wi-Fi networks.
        </p>
        <h3>How to protect against Man-in-the-middle attack</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions, like online banking.</li>
            <li>Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic.</li>
            <li>Always ensure the website you're visiting uses HTTPS://, indicated by a padlock icon.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Denial of Service (DoS) attack</h2>
        <p>In a DoS attack, the attacker overwhelms a server, website, or network with traffic, causing it to crash and
            become
            unavailable. This can disrupt services for businesses and individuals, making it impossible to access the
            internet
            service.
        </p>
        <h3>How to protect against Denial of Service attack</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter and monitor incoming traffic.</li>
            <li>Use load balancers or Content Delivery Networks (CDN) which share traffic load across servers in
                different locations.</li>
            <li>Implement DoS defence system or develop DoS response plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Social Engineering</h2>
        <p>Social engineering attacks refer to the manipulation technique to gain access to sensitive information. These
            attacks
            exploit trust and often come in the form of phone calls, emails, or even in-person interactions.
        </p>
        <h3>How to protect against Social Engineering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Be careful of the attempts that could lead you to revealing your credentials.</li>
            <li>Train employees and individuals to recognize signs of social engineering attempts.</li>
            <li>Always verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Defensive security practices</h2>

        <h3>Passwords</h3>
        <p>One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect your online accounts is to use strong, unique
            passwords. Avoid
            using easily guessable passwords. Instead, use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, and change
            your passwords
            regularly. You can use password manager to store your passwords. Additionally, enable 2FA wherever possible
            to add an
            extra layer of security.
        </p>

        <h3>Up-to-date software</h3>
        <p>Softwares frequently releases updates to patch security vulnerabilities. Failing to update your software,
            operating
            system, or applications can leave you exposed to cyber threats. Turn on automatic updates to ensure you're
            always
            running the latest, most secure versions.
        </p>

        <h3>Network monitoring</h3>
        <p>Regularly monitor your network for unusual activity. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion
            prevention systems
            (IPS) can help identify and block potential threats before they cause damage.
        </p>

        <h3>Firewalls</h3>
        <p>Firewalls act as a barrier between your internal network and the outside world, blocking malicious traffic
            from
            entering. Implement both software and hardware firewalls to ensure comprehensive protection. Firewalls help
            secure your
            devices and network from unauthorised access and potential cyberattacks.
        </p>

        <h3>Awareness</h3>
        <p>Human error is one of the biggest risks to cybersecurity. It is necessary to aware your friends and family
            about the
            potential cyber threats they can be exposed to and necessary defensive measures to implement.
        </p>

        <h3>Backups</h3>
        <p>In the event of a ransomware attack or data loss, having regular backups can save you from losing valuablel
            information.
            Make sure to back up your data to secure, offsite storage to ensure it can be recovered in case of an
            attack.
        </p>

        <p>In todayâ€™s connected world, cyber threats are inevitable. However, by practicing defensive security measures,
            we can
            significantly reduce the risks and protect ourselves from becoming a victim of cyberattacks. We should be
            proactive and
            keep us up to date with the vulnerabilities we are exposed to.</p>
