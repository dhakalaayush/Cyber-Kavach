        <img src="../../pictures/hacking.jpg">

        <p>Computers and networks can have several weaknesses or vulnerabilities. The act of exploiting these
            vulnerabilities is
            called hacking. For example, if a computer has a weak login password, say ‘qwerty’, then the act where
            someone
            unauthorized logs in by guessing ‘qwerty’ is hacking and that person is hacker. Hacking can be as small
            process as this,
            and can be much more complex.</p>
        <p>Hacking is the process of identifying vulnerabilities in a system and exploiting them. Generally, hacking is
            referred as
            being crime. But there are different types of hacking according to the motivations of the hacker.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>White hat hacker: White hat hackers or ethical hackers are the cybersecurity experts with good
                intention. They work to
                improve security of an organization. With permission and staying under the law, they help to assess,
                identify and fix
                security vulnerabilities in an organization system.</li>
            <li>Black hat hacker: Black hat hackers are unethical hackers. They operate illegally to hack other
                systems with the aim
                of financial gain, revenge, political goals, etc.</li>
            <li>Gray hat hacker: Gray hat hackers are the hackers who may become unethical but their intention is
                good. Hacktivists
                may fall under this category (but not every time).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why do hackers hack</h2>

                stealing credit card information or by deploying ransomware.</li>
            <li>Fun and learning: Hackers can also hack just for fun, learning or show off.</li>
            <li>Revenge: Hackers can hack enemy’s system for revenge purpose.</li>
            <li>Political gain: Political sides can also use hacking to gain benefits or advantage against another
