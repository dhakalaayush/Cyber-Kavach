        <p>Any meaningful data is information. Information is crucial. Some information is vital for works and some for
            personal
            matters. Information needs to be protected no matter what. Information has also been shaped into digital
            form. This
            makes information security even more critical.</p>
        <p>Information Security is the protection of information from any unauthorized or unwanted access, publicity,
            modification,
            destruction and more. Basically, we may not want the information we possess to be known by anyone and to be
            modified or
            destroyed. Information Security involves three main principles:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> It ensures that the data is kept secret and revealed to only those intended to.
                It
                keeps data secure.
                Example, a secret policy formed by an organization should be known only to some of the authorized
                members of the
                organization and not anyone else. Confidentiality is achieved to prevent data leaks.</li>
            <li><b>Integrity:</b> It ensures the consistency of data. The data is not changed or modified during the
                transmission. For
                example, if the organization wants to communicate with its branches regarding the secret policy, the
                message mustn’t be
                altered otherwise it won’t provide the actual intended message. Integrity is achieved to ensure the
                authenticity of
                data.</li>
            <li><b>Availability:</b> It ensures the consistency of data. The data is not changed or modified during the
                transmission. For
                example, if the organization wants to communicate with its branches regarding the secret policy, the
                message mustn’t be
                altered otherwise it won’t provide the actual intended message. Integrity is achieved to ensure the
                authenticity of
                data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance of Information Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It prevents data breach (leakage of data).</li>
            <li>It protects privacy.</li>
            <li>It protects reputation and financial losses.</li>
            <li>For businesses, it ensures smooth business operations.</li>
